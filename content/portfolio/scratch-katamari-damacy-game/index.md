## Project Abstract
The very first week of Harvard's [cs50x course](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/) introduces [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/), a visual programming language developed by MIT. After a quick crash course, we were asked to create any project of our choice (e.g. an interactive story, game, animation) subject to handful of technical requirements (at least one loop, at least one sound, etc.).

## Project Deliverable
### Instructions
> The King of All Cosmos broke Ursa Major, and now it's up to you to find replacement stars!
>
> Use the arrow keys to help the Prince move his katamari ball around the levels until it's big enough to undo your father's destruction.
>
> Your katamari starts small, but as you roll up more things, you'll be able to roll up bigger and bigger items.
>
> The level ends when you manage to roll up the largest item of all.

### Notes and Credits
Big thanks to Namco for giving the world the weird, delightful series that is Katamari Damacy. If you haven't had the opportunity to play one of the games, please treat yourself!
